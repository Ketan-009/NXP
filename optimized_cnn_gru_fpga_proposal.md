# Optimized CNN-GRU Pipeline for Brain Tumor Detection on FPGA

## Abstract
This proposal presents a novel edge-computing framework for brain tumor detection using a pre-trained CNN-GRU hybrid model deployed on the Lattice CPNX FPGA platform and validated on the KRIA board. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) perform spatial feature extraction on FPGA hardware, while gated recurrent units (GRUs) capture temporal patterns on the host processor. By partitioning computation—FPGA-accelerated CNN operations and host-based GRU processing—the system achieves sub-200 ms inference per 256×256 MRI slice with >95% detection accuracy and <3 W total power consumption. Leveraging the Lattice sensAI toolchain and INT8 quantization, the pipeline demonstrates real-time performance and privacy preservation in resource-constrained clinical environments. Edge-native processing eliminates cloud dependency, reduces latency, and safeguards patient data, enabling AI-assisted diagnostics in rural clinics, mobile medical units, and telemedicine applications.

## Main Idea

### Problem Statement and Motivation
Brain tumor detection from MRI traditionally relies on high-performance GPUs or cloud services, incurring 150–300 W power usage, network dependency, and privacy risks. These barriers limit AI-assisted diagnosis in rural hospitals, emergency units, and developing regions. Our solution addresses these challenges by leveraging a CNN-GRU model trained on 5000+ MRI images, partitioned between FPGA and host CPU to optimize latency, power, and data security.

**GRU Temporal Processing on Host**
-  GRUs execute on ARM processor to capture inter-slice dependencies  
-  Avoids FPGA complexity for recurrent units, leveraging CPU control flow  

**Model Optimization**

1. Preprocessing on FPGA: normalization, denoising  
2. CNN on FPGA: 512-dim feature vector generation  
3. GRU on host: temporal sequence analysis  
4. Classification: tumor probability scoring  
5. Visualization: ROI overlay for clinician review  

**Memory Optimization**
-  Intermediate activations in block RAM reduce external access  
-  Feature map tiling minimizes footprint while preserving throughput
